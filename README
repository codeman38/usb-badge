In order to build/run the utility, please do:

$ cd src ; make all
$ ./usb-badge-gui

To install, simply 'make install'. This will even install a .desktop file, so that the utility may be run from the Applications -> Accessories menu.

To uninstall, just do a simple 'make uninstall'.

This package requires GTK+ >= 2.14.0, libusb >= 0.1 (not 1.x), and libhid >= 2.6.15.

I wrote this for the fun and convenience of people who might have/use this product, and for those who might be interested in how it works.
