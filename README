In order to build/run the utility, please do:

$ cd src ; make all
$ ./usb-badge-gui

To install, simply 'make install'. This will even install a .desktop file, so that the utility may be run from the Applications -> Accessories menu.

To uninstall, just do a simple 'make uninstall'.

This package requires GTK+ >= 2.14.0, libusb >= 0.1 (not 1.x), and libhid >= 2.6.15.

I wrote this for the fun and convenience of people who might have/use this product, and for those who might be interested in how it works.

If you have issues running this as a non-root user, be sure to double-check your usbfs permissions. Also, double-check any udev rules you may have installed. If you see the following, your permissions probably aren't quite how you'd like them:

$ ls -l /dev/bus/usb/001
total 0
crw-rw-r-- 1 root root 189, 0 2009-12-14 09:12 001
$

In order to make this a bit more as you'd expect, you'll have to create 2 custom udev rules. Here's how to do it:

1. Create a file (as root) in /etc/udev/rules.d such as 1-fix_usb_perms.rules
2. Add the following rules into the file:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0664"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0664"

3. Ensure your user is a member of the group you specified ("plugdev" in this example.) Note that this will give any user in the specified group read and write access to the device.

In most cases, udev will automatically pickup the changes. Just to be sure, unplug and replug your device. Then try to run the program again.
